OpenNMS-RequisitionsToNotificationStragety
==========================================
## Requirements:
- `wget` must be in the search path
- `provision.pl` must be in the search path, if not customize the variable PROVISION_SCRIPT in provisioning.sh script
- Running Inventory Integration server with XLS requisition or fitting surveillance categories for generating notificiations.

## config.properties
- `prefix_generated`: notifications and destinationPaths add a `GEN_` prefix to identify the auto generated notifications from the manual configured notifications and destination paths. With the `prefix_generated` the default `GEN_` can be customized
- `prefix_team`: Defines which surveillance category prefix should be used to identify the target group in OpenNMS for the destination path.
- `prefix_transport`: Defines which surveillance category prefix should be used to identify the notification command used in the destination path.
- `notification_delay`: If not set the initial delay is set to 10 minutes.
- `notification_node_text`: Text message template for nodeDown notification
- `notification_service_text`: Text message template for nodeLostService notification
- `prefix_notification_token`: The team and transport categories will be combined in a single category called notification token. This notification tokens start with a prefix `NOTIFY`. This prefic can be modified with the `prefix_notification_token` parameter.
- `splitter`: The default splitter `__` splitts the elementes of the notification tokens

Please keep in mind that changing the prefixes requires the notification tokens to be different, so the script responsible for creating the notificaion tokens has to be changed to.
